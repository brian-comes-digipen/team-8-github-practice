-= non-art-asset observations (design notes) =-

1 second jump (from pressing W/Up Arrow to hitting ground, assume .5 seconds is peak of jump)

takes nearly 10 seconds from leftmost wall to reach windmill door when constantly pressing D/Right Arrow with all flies killed and facing left

a hit counts when the sword moves in and then out of an enemy's hitbox

dummy takes 10 hits
dummy does not damage player upon contact

small fly takes 3 hits
big fly takes 10 hits
fly wings seem to be made of semi-transparent circle sprites (stretched to be oval) that change vertical size to give illusion of wings

player has 10 HP, any hit from any fly deals 1 damage

all entities (player, dummy, fly) have edge-perfect hitbox

all background sprites (trees, flowers, mountains, clouds, sky, foreground bushes) do not have a parallax effect (for some reason my my copy of the game does not, others do have it)

camera not centered on player, smoothly shifts based on last movement key pressed (A = camera shows more to the left of player, W = vice versa)

player sprite direction based on mouse x position (greater than player x, face right, less than player x, face left)

flies have small green particle effect
fly entity used on title is same one from gameplay
when a fly dies, one-time white particle effect plays (a sort of "poof" effect)

seems to be a 1 second delay when dying (game over screen) or when winning (end screen)? could be hard drive / load times and not code/gameplay related

legs of player seems to be separate sprites
	walking animation seems to move them horizontally in a sine wave pattern (cycles)

game hooks into & responds mouse position even when window is not active

mouse is not locked to game window

health bar is never seen fully grayed out/dead (when it hits 0, still shows 1 while game over "level" loads)

-= speculation on scripts =-

basic health script attached to entity with editor-set (not hardcoded) start/max value
